# Learning C
Learning C with a variety of sources.

* CPT220 at university, which includes the following textbooks
  * The famous [ANSI C Programming Langauge 2nd Edition book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628).
  * [C How To Program 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/C-Program-Harvey-M-Deitel-ebook/dp/B008VIMQZ0)

## TODO

Eventually I will be doing:

* [Modern C](https://gustedt.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/modern-c-is-now-feature-complete/) to use modern practices as the above sources are quite old and use deprecated concepts.
* [C How To Program 8th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/How-Program-8th-Paul-Deitel/dp/0133976890)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Good bye world.");
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
