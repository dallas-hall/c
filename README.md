Learning C with a variety of sources.

* The famous ANSI C Programming Langauge book.
* A UNSW C course which is published on YouTube.
* A UniMelb course, which is based on the textbook from the UNSW course.

Eventually I will be doing Modern C to use modern practices as the above sources are quite old and use deprecated concepts.
