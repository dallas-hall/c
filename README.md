# Learning C
Learning C with a variety of sources.

* CPT220 at university, which includes the following textbooks
  * The famous ANSI C Programming Langauge book.
  * C How To Program 6th Edition

## TODO

Eventually I will be doing:

* Modern C to use modern practices as the above sources are quite old and use deprecated concepts.
* C How To Program 8th Edition

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Good bye world.");
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
