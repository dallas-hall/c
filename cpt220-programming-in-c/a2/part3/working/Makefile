# The object files on the right are required to compile the program's assembly files.
# Timestamps are used here to work out which files to recompile.
# Note: the required tab below the first line.

# Compiling the file
# The % is the wildcard here for all. We are getting all object, header, and source files.
# All object files (%.o) require matching source (%.c) and header files $(HEADERS).
# Note: the required tab below the first line
# $< refers to the first argument in the %.o:%.c $(HEADERS) line.
