 * this next section of the module is for enabling my solution to matching moves

 * The algorithm is based on the concept of a falsible pair tuple. A pair tuple
 * is a pair of a value and the original index it was located at. So the pair
 * tuple can have values removed or reorganised and we know what the original
 * index was in the array.
 *
 * I then put the pair_tuple into a struct with a boolean so it can define that
 * whether the requested operation can succeed and if it has, we then look at
 * that pair_tuple.
 *
 * This section is a good example of how an array can be returned and passed by
 * value by wrapping it in a struct. Please note that this idea / concept that
 * a struct enforces value semantics on its contents is one that has been
